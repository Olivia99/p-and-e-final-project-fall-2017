# Your Project Title Here

Colors convertor

## Summary
Converting colors to sounds with precoded notes. 

What was challenging:
* Understand how the code works
*figure out which code should be executed when the color sensor read different colors.
*build up the motor wheels to spin your color sheet with the right timing.

Interaction:
*people can print out the color sheet that represent the sound they wanted to hear and place the color sheet in the convertor to play the song.

*Press switch button to change the key note.


## Component Parts
Flora Color Sensor x1
Speaker x1
Motor x2 
transistor for motors x2
resistor x2
Arduino UNO board x2
wires 
battery x1 (or two separate batteries if you donâ€™t want to plug your Arduino in your laptop)

before you go to coding part, make sure following this tutorials online and download the libraries that are needed


### Code:

#include "Adafruit_TCS34725.h"
Adafruit_TCS34725 tcs = Adafruit_TCS34725(TCS34725_INTEGRATIONTIME_50MS, TCS34725_GAIN_4X);
int d = 2;
int leftMotorPin = 5;
int leftMotorSpeed = 250;
void setup() {
  pinMode(leftMotorPin, OUTPUT);
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);

  if (tcs.begin()) {
    Serial.println("Found sensor");
  } else {
    Serial.println("No TCS34725 found ... check your connections");
    while (1); // halt!
  }
  pinMode(2, INPUT);
}




Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a block diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.
